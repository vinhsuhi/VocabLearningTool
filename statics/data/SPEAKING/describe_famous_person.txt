NBC
Well, today I'm gonna talk about Ngo Bao Chau, who makes a name for himself as the most famous mathematcient.
You know, in Vietnam, the popularity of NBC is undeniable.

First of all, I want to share with u a brief overview of his career. 
NBC became a professor at Paris-Sud 11 University in 2005, and at the age of 33, He became the country's youngest-ever professor. 
Sine 2007, NBC has worked at Hanoi Institute of Mathematics. 

When it comes to his honors, In 2004, NBC were awarded the Clay Research Award for his achievement in solving the fundamental lemma.
In 2010, he recieved the Fields Medal, which can be considered to be equivalent to Nobel Price for mathematics. 

There are several reasons why I pay my respect and admiration for him. Firstly, NBC is a source of motivation not only for me but also for 
the young, who have a burning desire to be come a successful scientist. Secondly, he has been contributing for the development of Mathematics in 
VN, as well as the world. Finally, NBC not only does care about University student but he also inspires children by writing a significant number of books
