How to think in English and stop transtlating in your head.

- accidently see it on youtube, but this is what i was looking for all along
- so far, whenever I need to talk something in English, the first thing I do 
is making ideas in my native language, and then try to translate them to English.
- I realize that not only me, but a significant number of people share the same problem 
with me.
- So after watching the video, I summerize myself several tips to when through the translation:
    + Firstly, try to practice English with native 
    speaker when traveling. (most effectively way)
    + Secondly, I should read everything in english. Because this is the way to introduce 
    the practise of consumming information in english into my daily life.
    + The Third thing I think I should do is do some fun stuff in english.
    Such as watch movies without vietnamese subtitle or subscribe some english 
    youtube chanels.
    + Finally, learn any new concept in english, which mean, for example, if I 
    see a new word, instead of looking for it's mean in my language, I should 
    find the definition of this word in english. 

There may be other ways to solve that problem but these tips seems really fit to me.
